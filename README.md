## About Me
Iâ€™m a frontend developer with a passion for designing and coding out websites. I enjoy working on designs that focus on user experience, while also experimenting with new ideas to improve the look and feel of each project. 
Iâ€™m quite new at this, and most of my life I have worked at sea ðŸŒŠ or done freelance photography ðŸ“·. Coding has become a way for me to combine creativity with problem-solving, and I love the challenges that come with it!

When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me sipping coffee or tea â˜•, exploring new books ðŸ“š, taking photosðŸ“¸ or diving into other creative projects like watercolor painting ðŸŽ¨ or crochet ðŸ§¶.
